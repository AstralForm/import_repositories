#Certainly! Here's the script in Python:
The script will clone each repository from the source GitHub account to your local machine, create new repositories in the target GitHub account, and then push the cloned repositories to the target account. It will print status messages for each step of the process.

1.Open a text editor and create a new file, e.g., 
```bash
import_repositories.py
```
1.Download or copy the import_repositories.py file prresent in the repository
2.In the script, replace "source_username" with the username of the source GitHub account (from where you want to clone the repositories), "target_username" with the username of the target GitHub account (where you want to create the repositories and push the cloned repositories) and "target_personal_access_token" with the personal access token for the target account.
3.Modify the repositories list to include the names of the repositories you want to clone, create, and push.
4.Save the file.
5.Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the script, and run the following command to execute the script:
```bash
python import_repositories.py
```
Please note that you need appropriate access and permissions for both the source and target accounts (including the ability to create repositories and push to the target repositories) for this script to work correctly.
